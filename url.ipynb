However, this dread is somehow reduced in amount when you know exactly what lies ahead of you. That’s why we decided to come to your aid by compiling a list of the steps one ought to take to apply for an American university. Let’s get into it.\\n\\nWhy Study in the U.S.?\\n\\nThere is no surprise that the United States of America is one of the countries that host the largest number of international students globally. The education U.S universities provide, the curriculum they follow, the multicultural environment that characterizes the country are all factors that contribute to international students choosing this country to get their education. Does it sound like something you want, too? Then, follow this process to apply to one of the many American universities.\\n\\nHow to Apply for College in the USA for International Students?\\n\\nApplying for college can be a hassle in itself, especially for international students. Being thousands of miles away and part of an entirely different education system, they might find the whole application process quite demanding. No worries, we’ve got the backs of both domestic and international students. We’re going to show you all the steps to apply for college. Let’s get started:\\n\\nBuild your college list\\n\\nWith the thousands of universities to choose from, one might find it challenging to come to a decision. What if I am rushing this decision? What if there is a university with better opportunities? These are just some thoughts running through the mind of an average student. And they’re not at fault because there is always going to be a better college in many aspects. However, not all of them will prove to be the right ones for you, and the reasons might alternate between the distance, fees, and other related reasons.\\n\\nWhen making the list of the colleges you would like to apply to, you should consider your GPA and SAT/ACT scores. While these aren’t the most important pieces of the puzzle, as there are many other factors that admission officials consider, they still have a high impact on your admission chances. As much as you would want to get into a particular university, if you’re not eligible to apply because you don’t fulfill their requirements, you wouldn’t need to add that university to your list.\\n\\nWith that being said, take a look at their acceptance rate, grade and standardized test scores requirements, and tuition fees.\\n\\nHow many colleges should be on my college list?\\n\\nYour college list should be a mix of reach, target, and safety schools, respectively, the colleges you have a low chance of getting in, the colleges you have a pretty good shot, and colleges that you are almost sure you can get in. So, your college list should contain 8 to 10 schools. However, if you believe that you’re applying to highly competitive colleges, it would be better to increase the number of colleges to 12.\\n\\nGet your transcript evaluated\\n\\nThis step mostly depends on where the students are coming from. Usually, evaluating transcripts is required of international students. Admission counselors require this official report so that they can determine whether a degree or other credentials earned in a foreign country meet their enrollment standards.\\n\\nHowever, if you want to make sure of this, you can always contact the admission office of a particular university and get an official answer from them.\\n\\nPrepare recommendation letters\\n\\nLetters of recommendation are the additional documents that help round out a student’s profile. These letters provide insights for the admission counselors as to who you are through the lens of someone other than you. Usually, those who are expected to write recommendation letters for you have worked closely with you during your educational journey and can recommend an individual’s academic performance, i.e., your teachers, your principal, or your counselors.\\n\\nGet aware of the language requirements\\n\\nEvery university lists the requirements the students must meet in order to get enrolled in their programs. The list might start with the high school diploma, a particular GPS, extracurriculars, and others. One of the requirements is also the language requirement. This requirement applies to international students whose first language is other than the English language. Usually, this is handled through a standardized test like IELTS or TOEFL. Either way, you have to make sure that you are/aren’t required to prove your English language proficiency.\\n\\nGet informed on the standardized tests you’re going to take\\n\\nBesides the TOEFL and IELTS tests that international students usually take to prove their language abilities,\\xa0 students might be required to take a whole list of standardized tests. Which test scores you might be asked to provide varies from university to university. That’s why in your research where you come up with the list of universities you want to apply to, you should also consider this requirement.\\n\\nSend Application Forms\\n\\nNow that you got your list of colleges ready, you can start applying to them. However, we mentioned how universities make their admission decisions by considering your academic record as well as the scores you got on different standardized tests like TOEFL, ACT, SAT, GRE, or GMAT.\\n\\nThis application form is sent to you by the admissions office, or you can find it online on their website. Its fee is non-refundable and ranges from $35 to $100. Once you’ve attached your supporting documents like, transcript, standardized tests scores, and any other documents that the university might require of you, you’re ready to hit submit.\\n\\n✅ Request information on BAU's programs TODAY!\\n\\nBA in Accounting BA in Business Administration & Management BA in Economics & Finance BA in Political Science & International Relations BS in Data Science BS in Information Technologies MBA MSc in Big Data Analytics MSc in Cyber Security\\n\\nTake the Entrance Exam\\n\\nAnother significantly necessary requirement of U.S universities is the entrance exam. All the prospective students of a particular college are required to take it. So, you too, as an international student, should expect to take it.\\n\\nThere are several different exams out there, that’s why you should do research on which entrance exams are required by your universities of choice and then register for them.\\n\\nWait for the Acceptance Letter to Come\\n\\nAssuming that you have respected the deadlines and you’ve submitted your application form and other documents on time, now you got nothing else to worry about other than wait for a positive response from the universities you’ve applied for. One by one, the universities will start to send you letters to inform you of your application. Some might do it earlier, and some might wait for a period of time and then inform all the candidates at the same time.\\n\\nHow to Pay for College?\\n\\nWhen thinking of applying for college, many students consider their financial situation as most likely they’ll have to pay for college from their own family pockets. However, for those who can’t afford to pay for college, there is still hope as there are other ways they can pay for it, through financial aid and scholarships offered by the universities.\\n\\nFinancial aid\\n\\nFinancial aid is provided from various sources; federal and state agencies, colleges, high schools, different foundations are just some of them. Here are some of the types of financial aid that students in the USA are eligible to receive:\\n\\nGrants\\n\\nGrants are a type of financial aid that students receive without having to repay. The grants can come from non-profit organizations, the federal government, or your college.\\n\\nScholarships\\n\\nScholarships are a type of financial aid awarded to students by the universities to pay for their degree. There are many types of scholarships available; however, not everybody can be eligible to get them as they have requirements students will have to meet.\\n\\nStudent loans\\n\\nWhen applying for financial aid, you might be offered student loans. You will repay your student loan debt with interest, and you start paying them after you graduate. The amount of money you can borrow depends on the level of your academic studies, whether you’re an undergraduate, graduate, or a professional student.\\n\\nSo, there you have it, the process of applying for college is right in front of you. We hope we have made it easy and clear what is expected of you in this process. All that’s left to do is for you to start preparing your documentation and start applying. The best of luck!\\n\\nTotal\\n\\nShares\\n\\nShare 0\\n\\nTweet 0\\n\\nPin it 0\\n\\nShare 0\\n\\nBay Atlantic University\\n\\nINTERNATIONAL STUDENTS\\n\\n4 minute read\\n\\nTop 8 Benefits of Studying in the U.S.\\n\\nBay Atlantic University\\n\\nJuly 17, 2020\\n\\nTable of Contents 1.

       " Document(page_content=\"Applying for Admission to a U.S. Program\\n\\nOct 31, 2022\\n\\nEach U.S. university and college sets its own admission standards and decides which applicants meet those standards.\\n\\nThe college admissions process is time-consuming, tedious, and at times, a bit daunting. Luckily, many universities and colleges are looking to enroll international students like you.\\xa0Read on to learn more about the U.S. college application process for international students, including timelines, requirements, tips, and how we can help you.\\n\\nEven if you have selected one school where you are sure you want to study abroad, you should still apply to other schools—it is possible that your “first choice” school may not accept you. At least one or two of your choices should be schools where you and your advisor are fairly certain you will be admitted. Remember that you are competing with prospective international students from all over the world for a limited number of spaces.\\n\\nWhat are the General Admission Requirements to Study in the USA?\\n\\nCollege Surprise: Admission with Conditions\\n\\nAdmissions Tests for International Students\\n\\nMost schools in the USA encourage prospective international students to contact their admissions office at least one year before planning to enter that school.\\n\\nFollow these helpful steps as you apply for admission to U.S. universities and colleges:\\n\\nTiming\\n\\nThe best time for you to prepare your application depends on when you want to start your studies. Universities and colleges in the US usually offer two main academic terms: Spring terms run from January to May, and Fall terms (also known as Autumn) run from mid-August or September to December. Some universities also offer short Summer terms between June and July.\\n\\nWhile each US university and college will have different dates for applying to programs, application submissions are usually open and accepted 10 months before the program starts. Plan accordingly for your own applications: It can be helpful to start preparing to apply at least 10 months before application submission deadlines.\\n\\nDepending on how many universities you are considering, it can take weeks or even months to research all your options and prepare your applications. By starting well in advance, you can give yourself time to evaluate all your options and apply without rushing.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nEach institution has its own application form for you to fill out and all US universities which accept international students give you the option to apply online through their website. Keep in mind that many US institutions charge an application fee. You may also be able to apply via a standardized application that multiple schools use, such as the\\xa0Common App.\\n\\nWrite to Several Schools\\n\\nAfter you have selected the schools you want to attend, contact each school for an application form and more international student admission information. You can use the school advertisements throughout this magazine and StudyUSA.com as information resources to help you make your choice. On the website, you can contact schools directly to request information.\\n\\nIf you wish to apply for a graduate (postgraduate) program you should verify the admission requirements with the specific graduate school within the university. Many graduate programs have higher admission standards, and some programs require that you send your application directly to their department. You should be in good academic standing if you expect to be admitted to a graduate program. Contact either the admissions office of the graduate school or the chairperson of the department.\\n\\nPlease mention that you learned about the school from Study in the USA®.\\n\\nRegister for Admissions Tests\\n\\nStudents applying to universities and colleges in the USA must take certain examinations (SAT, ACT, GMAT, etc.) that measure aptitude and achievement. International students must also take a test that measures English language proficiency. These tests are given at test centers around the world. They are “standardized,” so that students take the same test at every test center. Your scores give the admissions office a uniform international standard for measuring your ability in comparison with other students.\\n\\nMost undergraduate applicants to universities in English-speaking countries will be required to take either the TOEFL or the IELTS if their native language is not English.\\n\\nTake the Admissions Tests\\n\\nYour test scores are sent directly to the schools to which you are applying. You will be asked to indicate the names of these schools when you register to take certain tests, such as the SAT or ACT. In the case of computer-based tests, you will designate the schools at the exam site and the testing agencies will mail your scores directly to them. There will be a fee for scores that you request at a later date.\\n\\nReceive Acceptance Letters\\n\\nAfter the application deadline, you will begin receiving letters from your chosen schools. Some universities inform candidates of their acceptance soon after their documents have arrived in the admissions office; this is called “rolling admissions.” Other schools, however, wait several months and inform all candidates at one time.\\n\\nPay Your Deposit\\n\\nMost universities require students to pay a deposit by a certain deadline in order to reserve a space in the entering class. For international students, this deposit can be as high as a semester’s or a full year’s tuition.\\n\\nYou should send your deposit immediately if you are applying for financial aid or if you plan to live in university housing. Because many schools do not have enough campus housing for all the students, you will have a better chance of getting a room on campus if you send your housing application and room deposit fee as quickly as possible.\\n\\nYou may also be required to provide a statement indicating how much money you will have available during the years you will be in school. If you have a scholarship or your government or company is sponsoring you, you will need to send details of your award.\\n\\nWrite an Awesome Essay\\n\\nYou may not be familiar with the American practice of writing a personal essay to submit with your university application. Here are some tips on how to write an awesome essay!\\n\\nStep 1: Think of a great topic. Your essay topic should have personal meaning for you. It should reveal something about who you are, your values or interests, and how you are different from any other applicant. Write something about yourself that cannot be reflected by your grades, the list of classes that you’ve taken, or in any other part of your application. There are several questions you can ask yourself that will help you think of ideas: (1) What are you like? (2) What have you done? (3) What are your goals?\\n\\nTop Dos and Don'ts for Choosing the Right Admission Essay Topic\\n\\nInternational Student Admissions: Checking things off the list!\\n\\nConditional admission gives students a chance to improve their English\\n\\nStep 2: Write your essay. Good writing takes time. Don’t rush or expect to finish your essay in one afternoon. Pay special attention to the introduction. Draw in the reader so that he or she is interested in finding what the rest of your essay will reveal. Use simple words to express your ideas; you don’t have to use complex vocabulary words to show how much English you know. Use the language to express yourself, not prove your smartness. If you make a statement, give an example to demonstrate your point.\\n\\nStep 3: Take your time and ask for help. Leave yourself enough time so that you can stop working on your essay for a few days—even a week—and then come back to it. This will allow you to read your essay with a fresh perspective. Also, have your friends and family read your essay—they will be able to see things you’ve missed or neglected to mention. Have fun, take your time, be yourself and tell your story well!\\n\\nFollow us:\\n\\nStudy in the USA ®\\n\\nGet matched to the best program for you\\n\\nLet us know what you're looking for so we can find the best school for you.\\n\\nGet matched\\n\\nUseful Articles\\n\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania ELP Profile: Shenglan J. of China\\n\\nInternational Triple-Major Thrives at Lycoming College\\n\\nHow Counselors Can Help International Families Prepare for University\\n\\nUnlocking the Universe: From Forbes 30 Under 30 to New Frontiers in Science\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nCheck Out These Schools\\n\\nCalifornia State University, Monterey Bay\\n\\n$25,000—$30,000 Year\\n\\nSummer\\n\\nOnline\\n\\nEnglish Programs\\n\\nContact\\n\\nUniversity of Florida ELI\\n\\n$1,000—$5,000 Semester\\n\\nEnglish Programs\\n\\nCertificate/Short Term\\n\\nUndergraduate\\n\\nContact\\n\\nAuburn University\\n\\n$40,000—$45,000 Year\\n\\nBachelor Degree\\n\\nUndergraduate\\n\\nMasters\\n\\nContact\\n\\nFeatured Programs\\n\\nMississippi College\\n\\nTypical cost per Year: $15,000—$20,000\\n\\nBachelor Degree\\n\\nMasters\\n\\nCertificate/Short Term\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nHillsborough Community College\\n\\nTypical cost per Year: $10,000 — $15,000\\n\\nBachelor Degree\\n\\nCertificate/Short Term\\n\\n2yr/Community College - 2+2 Programs\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nBerkeley Global\\n\\nTypical cost per Semester: $15,000—$20,000\\n\\nBachelor Degree\\n\\nMasters\\n\\nSecondary/Boarding\\n\\nLearn More\\n\\nRelated Stories\\n\\n21st Century Student: The role of School\\n\\nThe 21st-Century Student: The Role of School\\n\\nThe twenty first century student and university: what you need to consider\\n\\nFinding the Type of School That Fits You\\n\\nStart your U.S. adventure with Study in the USA\\n\\nMore about us\\n\\nPartner Services\\n\\nLearn About U.S. education financing, housing, and more\\n\\nA world of greater possibility.\\n\\nFollow your dreams with the TOEFL iBT® test, which has helped millions of students study abroad.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nA cheaper, faster way to send money abroad\\n\\nJoin over 6 million people and businesses who get a better deal when they send money with the real exchange rate.\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nStudent Advantage\\n\\nExplore the American Dream with the ‘My Deals’ app from Student Advantage - save on car rentals, hotel rooms, and everyday essentials!\\n\\nRead more\\n\\nTestimonials\\n\\nI was able to learn more about the opportunities and school programs available to international students in the US and I would not have made it this far without Study in the USA.\\n\\nStudyUSA has helped me determine what school to choose and has also opened my eyes to see the benefits of studying in the USA.\\n\\nThe Study in the USA website always provides me with information about universities.\\n\\nResources\\n\\nLearn about American culture and education direct from our experts at Study in the USA.

For programs like MBA, you might also be needed to submit MBA admission essays, and while for PhD in USA, you will be asked to provide a research proposal.\\n\\nHere are some pointers on how to produce an outstanding essay:\\n\\nConsider and choose an interesting/fascinating topic. Your essay topic should be meaningful to you. It should show something about your personality, values, or hobbies, as well as how you differ from other applicants.\\n\\nComplete your essay. It takes time to write well. Don’t try to finish your essay in one afternoon. Take careful note of the introduction. Draw the reader in so that he or she is curious about what the rest of your essay will disclose.\\n\\nEmploy simple phrases to describe your ideas; you do not need to use complicated vocabulary words to demonstrate your command of the English language.\\n\\nTake your time and seek assistance. Allow yourself ample time to go away from your essay for a few days, if not a week, and then return to it. This will help you to reread your essay with new eyes.\\n\\nRequest that your mentors, instructors, friends, and family read your essay since they will notice issues you have overlooked or forgotten to mention.\\n\\nOur Leverage Edu head coaches and mentors can also guide you through this step at the admissions process by helping you draft impressive SOP and LORs as well as in resume structuring.

Fill Out the Application Form\\n\\nNow that you will be ready with your scores and essays, the next step is to gear up your complete college application to study in USA. You must remember that US universities admissions are based on student’s academic records and applicable test scores such as IELTS/TOEFL, SAT or ACT. You might also be required to submit GMAT or GRE scores depending upon the course you’re applying for. You will have to pay an application processing fee which varies from $35-$100. Further, if you also want to apply for a scholarship at the same university, you will be needed to enclose your scholarship application along with the application form.\\n\\nPost that, the admission office will review your marks earned during the last four years of the secondary school along with your college marks if you are applying for a postgraduate program.\\n\\nExplore the Scholarships to Study in USA!\\n\\n7. Wait for the Acceptance Letter\\n\\nOnce you have submitted all the required documents before the deadline, you will have to wait to hear the final result and if your application is an impressive one, you will get the acceptance letter(s) from the universities that shortlisted you!\\n\\n8. Receive Acceptance Letters\\n\\nAfter the application deadline, you will start getting acceptance letters from the universities you have chosen. Some universities notify candidates of their acceptance as soon as their documents arrive in the admissions office; this is referred to as “rolling admissions.” Other universities, on the other hand, wait many months before informing all candidates.\\n\\n9. Fee Deposit\\n\\nAfter receiving your acceptance letter, you will be required to deposit your fees to the selected university. As for most universities, they have a deadline under which you are required to pay. It is advised to pay the fees as early as possible especially if you are planning on getting a room at the campus as they get filled up pretty fast.\\n\\n10. Fill out I-20 Form and Apply for Student Visa\\n\\nAfter getting accepted at a school and depositing your fee, you will receive an I-20 form from your designated school. The form is an important document that helps you get your student visa and you should keep it safe for your entire international student life cycle. While entering the country, you will be required to have the original form with you. Thus, this would be the concluding step of the admission process to study in USA as now you will have to sort out other aspects like accommodation, USA Student Visa application, etc.\\n\\nKnow the Cost of Studying in USA!\\n\\nFAQs\\n\\nAmerican university student culture may be defined as a “work hard, play hard” society. Classes are intellectually demanding, with a lot of homework, and many students have part-time jobs to help pay for their education. Many colleges in the United States offer outstanding facilities for both sports and academics.\\n\\nScholarships are available to international students at a number of colleges and educational institutes in the United States. With these scholarships, you may study undergraduate and postgraduate courses in the United States for a reasonable and inexpensive price.\\n\\nA minimum academic record of 65 percent or higher in the humanities stream in class XII, and 70 – 80 percent or higher in the science/commerce stream in class XII, will also be required. Students with less than a 60 percent grade point average can enroll in Foundations and Diploma programs.\\n\\nIn the United States, there are three intake options: Fall: The Fall intake is popular among Indian students and begins in September. Spring: Begin in January; ideal if you miss the September intake. Summer: Available for a limited number of programs and universities, the Summer intake typically begins in May.\\n\\nThus, the admission process to study in the USA can be quite cumbersome and complex at certain steps.
